## Code style guidelines

A few, simple guidelines onto how code contributed to Sokora should look like.

- Keep a consistent indentation of two spaces. Don't use tabs.
- Use `K&R` style for bracket placement (`function() {}` instead of `function() \n {}`).
- Use `camelCase` for both variables and function names.
- Keep lines reasonably short, don't fear linebreaks. Of course, longer lines are valid where needed.
- Use early returns to avoid nesting.
- Avoid curly braces in one-line `if` statements.
- Non-nullish assertions are valid when needed.
- Prefer strict comparisons (`===` / `!==`).
- Use the cache instead of a new `fetch()` call where possible, to avoid unnecessary usage (e.g., if possible, prefer `guild.members.cache` over `await guild.members.fetch()`).
